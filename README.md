# Weather App

This week we are building a weather app from an open API. We also started working with branches in github for the first time.

## The problem

This project was built with the fetch() method in javascript where we learned how to use promises and basic json, and also how to work with Date() method i js. The most difficult thing this week was how to make the weather forecast work properly by filtering an using map to get to be able to display the correct data from the API. It was also quite difficult to make the search for new location to work properly with the forecast. If we had more time we would style the site even more and add extra features from the API.
